## Step-by-Step Guide to Cooking Frozen Hash Browns in Air Fryer

Here‚Äôs a foolproof method to cook **frozen hash browns in air fryer** for that perfect crispy texture. Follow these steps for restaurant-quality results at home.

- Tongs or a spatula for flipping
- Optional: Parchment paper or an air fryer liner for easy cleanup

5. **Check for Doneness**: Look for a golden-brown, crispy exterior. If needed, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

### Cooking Times by Hash Brown Type
